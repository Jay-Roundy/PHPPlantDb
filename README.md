# PHPPlantDb
Jason Roundy
Semester 2 Student Project

This is a plant database, a user database, and a comment database, to keep track of information on your garden. The style of the page is limited to a table like format from the lack of css and bootstrap experience at the time. You can sign up, log in, enter new plants, add comments, and update information on plants.
The Plant database class holds the data access and manipulation code.
